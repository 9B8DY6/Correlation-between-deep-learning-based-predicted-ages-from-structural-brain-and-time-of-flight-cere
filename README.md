# Correlation between deep learning based predicted ages from structural brain and time-of-flight cerebral angiography

Correlation between deep learning based predicted ages from structural brain and time-of-flight cerebral angiography, **ASMRM&ICMRI 2020**

It is a task to estimate brain age with MRA or T1 and anaylze correlation between two estiamted ages and chronological age.
